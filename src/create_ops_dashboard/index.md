1. Add graphs and content to customize your dashboard. Select **Save** when complete. Depending on which layers you are basing your graphs off, you can see real-time updates of your project data collection. The demo project dashboards are [Project Rose - Overview Dashboard](https://arcg.is/0DSWjC), [Project Rose - Resource Metrics](https://arcg.is/19z5yH), [Project Rose - QA Dashboard](https://arcg.is/0a1WjT).
