**Notes**
1. If you're in a new session, clicking **Map** will open a new map. Otherwise, it will open an existing map (the last map you were using). If an existing map opens, click **New Map**, and choose **Create New Map**.
2. If you save the map, the map extent at the time of saving will become the extent used by the **Default extent** button. It can also be useful to add spatial bookmarks to navigate to particular map locations.
3. Layer properties are always accessed in the same way: by pointing to the layer name and clicking an appropriate button or clicking the **More Options** button and choosing the property you want to change.
4. The usual practice is to put points above lines, and lines above polygons. Points, lines, and polygons are all feature layers: they usually represent discrete geographic objects that have more or less precise locations and boundaries.
5. Tile layers are images and cannot be manipulated in the same ways as feature layers. They typically represent large, continuous surfaces rather than discrete objects. Tile layers cannot be moved above feature layers in a map.
6. When you start a new map, or open one of your own saved maps, it opens with the **Contents** pane showing. When anyone else opens a map created by you, however, it opens with the **Legend** pane showing. 
7. A layer's default display settings, including its style and pop-up configuration, are made by its owner. Once you add a layer to your own map, however, you're free to change those settings.
