    If you do not know the official language or subtag to use, please search for the language from this link: https://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry

3. The second language field header should follow this pattern

    label::Description (subtag)

    For example, for the Indonesian language the syntax would be

    label::Indonesian (id)

4. Note that the description name upholds proper capitalization, or proper casing, while the subtag is completely uncapitalized 

    Also please note that there is only a space between the description and the open parenthesize

    Here is how the final result would look like:
